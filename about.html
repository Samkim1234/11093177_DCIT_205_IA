        <div class="about-text1-a">
            <p>The Computer Science Department at the University of Ghana was established in August 2003 as one of the five (5)  Departments under the Faculty of Applied  Sciences. The Department was founded as part of the University's strategic objective of developing the human resources needs in key technologies required to provide the foundation for the 21st century technological developmental base for the country. The Department has since its establishment, successfully graduated 49 out of 54 students (90.7%) from the first four pioneering groups. The current number of students in the Department as of December 2019 stands at 296, comprising 88 students at Level 100, 80 students at Level 200, 84 students at Level 300, and 44 students at Level 400.</p>

            <p>The population of female students is 18.5%. The Department currently has 8 full-time teaching staff (1 staff on PhD study leave), 6 part-time staff, 8 teaching assistants, 8 national service personnel, 3 technical supporting staff, and 1 administrative assistant. The state of the Department generally remains strong as a result of a combination of aggressive efforts to provide quality teaching, hiring new faculty, facilitate upgrading of teaching staff with MPhil degree to PhD, revitalize the undergraduate curriculum, and promoting short term visits by Visiting Scholars. Since its establishment, the Department has continued its efforts to run a broadly based Engineering discipline in software systems, computer networks, information processing and transmission, wireless communication system, embedded technologies, and hardware systems. Currently, with the advent of AI and Machine learning trends in computer engineering, our students have been exposed to conducting research and applications with these technologies to aid in nation-building and enhancing their job prospects. These core areas provide the undergraduates with skills required to solve emerging problems in the industry as well as serving as the foundation for research and graduate studies.</p>

                This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer Science. The study of computer science is therefore critical if society is to take full advantage of the benefits Information Technology has to offer and make rapid economic advances. Computer science involves the study and development of applications that allow for our everyday use of computers, the software systems that support these applications, and the means and methods used to produce both applications and systems that behave reliably, correctly and ethically. At the heart of Computer Science lies the skill of computer programming and employers who hire Computer Scientists expect adept programmers with knowledge of current techniques and tools and the ability to apply sound engineering principles to the development, construction and maintenance of computer programs.
